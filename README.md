# HeartDiseasePrediction-withR
The objective of this project is to predict individuals who are likely to develop heart disease within the next 10 years. 
In order to achieve this, we will analyze the correlation between various variables and the label variable, 
which indicates the presence or absence of heart disease. Additionally,
we will examine the distribution of each variable and identify any influential data points that may have a significant impact on the results.

To ensure accurate analysis, we will also check for missing values in the dataset and handle them using distribution information. 
Furthermore, we will explore any linear relationships between the variables and consider transforming the data if necessary.

For modeling purposes, we will employ logistic regression and assess whether the underlying assumptions are met. 
Finally, based on the logistic regression model, we will evaluate the accuracy of our predictions, which is expected to be around 80.12%.

Overall, this project aims to develop a predictive model that can effectively 
-identify individuals who have a higher risk of developing heart disease within the next decade.
